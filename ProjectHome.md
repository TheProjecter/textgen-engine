Currently in progress. This engine is designed to support games that are primarily text-based, with optional static images, sound, and music support in a GUI environment. The plan is to bundle an editor along with the engine and use human-readable XML files to store all game information, minimizing the need for coding experience for those who want to create games with the TextGen Engine.

Ideally, the engine will be able to produce games like [Darklands](http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/darklands) and [King of Dragon Pass](http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/king-of-dragon-pass), along with many simpler projects like the classic text adventures.
